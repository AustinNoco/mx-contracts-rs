# Liquid Locking Contract

This contract facilitates staking and unstaking of ESDT tokens.

The owner of the contract will set an unbonding period which will represent the number of epochs after unstaking when the tokens are available for claim.

Stake, unstake and unbond work with multiple token calls.
